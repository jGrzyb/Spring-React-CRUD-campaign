# Spring-React-CRUD-campaign

Hello, this is my simple CRUD application that manages campaigns.

It allows to:
1. See all campaigns
2. Remove campaigns
3. Add new campaigns where cost is deducted from "bank" account
4. Edit existing campaign without loosing "money" from "bank" account

Repository contains backend and frontend server. 

## To run whole application you should:
1. Run BackendApplication class from Backend folder
2. Run "npm install" and "npm run dev" from Frontend folder
